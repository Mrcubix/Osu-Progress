# Explanation:

A tool that increase the length of a map every time you complete it, could be used to train endurance.  
The length modification depend on the user input.  
Gosumemory will be required.  
A websocket will be required to receive the data.

## TODO:

- Increasing length multiplier with each level completed
- Optional bpm multiplier on section completion?
- UI?
